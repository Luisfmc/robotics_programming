Example of branch situacion.
Let's imagine that we have a work team, and this is divided into 3 branches which are destined to deliver a final product to a client.

First we have branch 1, where the team programs and makes modifications to the code.
This team, having the modifications ready, makes a commit to update the information.

The second branch is that of testing the code, it is in charge of analyzing all the modifications so that none of them causes an error.

And the third branch, applies the new code that the previous branches modified in a real situation to confirm that everything is fine.

Once the code is functional and without errors, the main branch is updated.
