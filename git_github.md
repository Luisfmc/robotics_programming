# GitHub
In this Markdown we will see everything about ***GitHub***, we will learn how to create and use a repository, start and manage a new **branch**, make changes to the file and push them to ***github*** as **commit**, open and perform a **pull request**.

How create a repository?

1. We need to register an account with github.com.

2. Once we access the account, we will need to create a new repository, click `+` and then select **New repository**.

3. Name your repository ***robotics_programming***.

4. Click **Create repository**

## Branch

When creating a repository, we default to the `main` branch which is considered to be the definitive branch. A branch off `main` help us edit our files without modify the `main` branch.

**How to create a branch?**


1. Go to your repository `robotics_programming`.

2. Click **Branch: Main**

3. Type a branch name `Edits` into the new branch text box.

4. Select **Create branch** box.


**Example of branch situacion.**

Let's imagine that we have a work team, and this is divided into 3 branches which are destined to deliver a final product to a client.

>First we have branch 1, where the team programs and makes modifications to the code.

>This team, having the modifications ready, makes a `commit` to update the information.

>The second branch is that of testing the code, it is in charge of analyzing all the modifications so that none of them causes an error.

>And the third `branch`, applies the new code that the previous branches modified in a real situation to confirm that everything is fine.

Once the code is functional and without errors, the `main` branch is updated.

## Commit.

A commit can be seen as a photograph of the modifications into our file, each commit is named after a description of the general modification in that phase.

***To create a commit we must follow these steps:***

1. Click `git_github.md` file.
2. Click the pencil icon *(Edit this file)*.
3. Write your modications.
4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.
5. Click **Commit changes** button.

Commits can be contained within different branch or directly a modification of the branch main.
